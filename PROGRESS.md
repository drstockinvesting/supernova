# Supernova — Progress Tracker

Carried across working sessions. Each session appends to the decision log rather than
rewriting it, so the reasoning behind the build stays legible.

- [ ] Generator core (config, rng, calendar, archetypes)
- [ ] Organization + curriculum entities
- [ ] Seven student data streams
- [ ] Longitudinal years + aggregates
- [ ] JSON schemas + validation suite
- [ ] Full generation passing validation

## Decision Log

### 2026-08-16 — Session 1

**Repo lives in iCloud Drive, in place.** Chosen over a local-only repo for convenience.
Accepted risk: `.git` internals sync through iCloud, which can corrupt a repo if two machines
write at once. Mitigation — push to GitHub after every session so the remote is the real
backup; never work the repo from two machines simultaneously.

**Generator is Python 3, stdlib only.** No Node on this machine, and no install step wanted.
Emits JSON, which keeps data generation cleanly decoupled from whatever the UI is built in.
If the UI session wants shared types, TypeScript interfaces can be emitted alongside later.

**District scoped to 3 schools / ~1,100 students / 3 years.** Large enough that district- and
board-level dashboards have something real to aggregate, small enough to regenerate quickly
while iterating.

**Elementary and secondary are modeled differently.** Nova Elementary is self-contained (one
teacher, all six subjects); Meridian and Constellation are departmentalized (six subject
sections per student). This changes what a "classroom card" means at each school and exercises
the fractal architecture against two genuinely different structures instead of one.

**Standards are real, curated.** Authentic codes and text from CCSS, NGSS, C3, NCAS, and SHAPE
America — roughly 8–12 per subject per grade. A domain expert reviewing this as a portfolio
piece would immediately spot invented standards.

**Schema extended via addendum, originals untouched.** The UI/UX doc describes dashboard
elements with no backing record type in `supernova-data-structures.md` — teachers, sections,
curriculum units, interruptions, homework completion, user roles, guardians, the school
calendar, and research citations. These are defined in
`docs/supernova-data-structures-addendum.md` as an additive, reviewable change. The five
original spec documents are not edited.

**Archetypes restructured into three axes** (tier × trajectory × situation) instead of the
flat seven-archetype list. Tier maps directly onto the `evidenceStrength` enum already in the
schema: High Achiever produces substantial evidence across nearly all standards, Typical
produces moderate evidence on most, Underachiever produces insubstantial evidence in many
places and often none at all. Trajectory absorbs "Late Start, Strong Finish" as an
Underachiever who is Rising — the same student moving, rather than a separate kind of student.
Situation drives the non-academic streams and determines *where* gaps localize; tier determines
*how deep* they run. Tier is drawn conditional on situation so implausible pairings (a High
Achiever with severe chronic absenteeism) don't occur.

**Full evidence artifacts for the current year only.** Prior years carry mastery records with
evidence counts plus benchmark and screener results — which is what `PriorAchievementRecord`
specifies, not a shortcut. Keeps the dataset around 60MB rather than several hundred.

## Open Questions

Carried forward from `docs/lms-vision-document.md` and not resolved in Phase 1:

- How does mastery mapping integrate with standardized testing requirements?
- What behavioral data should be visible to parents? (sensitivity balance)
- What role does student self-assessment play in validating mastery?
- How does the system handle skill prerequisites and interdependencies?
- What research sources are authoritative for the context layer? *(Phase 1 seeds a starter
  citation library; it needs review before it appears in any stakeholder-facing view.)*

Raised during Phase 1:

- Should mastery "re-demonstration" be surfaced in the UI as a distinct visual state, or is it
  invisible detail? The data supports either.
- Community dashboard shows aggregates only — but with three schools, a single-school
  aggregate may still be small enough to be identifying at the extremes. Worth a threshold
  rule in Phase 3.

## Notes for the Next Session

Phase 2 (UI/UX) should start by reading `docs/supernova-data-structures-addendum.md` alongside
the original data structures doc, then `data/manifest.json` for what actually exists. Every UI
element named in the addendum's gap table has data behind it.
